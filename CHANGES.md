## v1.1.7 — 2026-02-24

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (PR #26)
- Fixed Android dev release APK being **unsigned**, causing "invalid app" rejection when sideloading onto a test device.
- Added `signingConfig signingConfigs.debug` to the `release` build type in `android-native/app/build.gradle`; the debug keystore is auto-generated by the Android SDK on every CI runner so no secrets are required.
- Bumped Android `versionCode` from `3` → `4` and `versionName` from `0.2.1a` → `0.2.2` to produce a distinct, identifiable build.

## v1.1.6 — 2026-02-24

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (PR #24)
- Fixed `build-release-artifacts` job in `auto-release.yml` being silently skipped due to GitHub Actions dropping `if:` conditions on reusable-workflow call jobs; gating is now delegated to the `needs:` dependency chain.
- Fixed `pr-release.yml` bash crash on alpha version strings (e.g. `1.1.5a`): strip non-numeric suffix before integer arithmetic.
- Removed permanent alpha suffix appended unconditionally by `version-bump.yml`.

## v1.1.4 — 2026-02-24

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (PR #23)
- Fixed Android APK (and all other artifacts) never being uploaded to the GitHub Releases page when the workflow was triggered via `workflow_dispatch`.
- Replaced overly restrictive `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')` guard on the `Create GitHub Release` step with an explicit allowlist that also permits `workflow_dispatch`.
- Added explicit `tag_name` to the `Create GitHub Release` step so `softprops/action-gh-release` resolves the correct release during `workflow_dispatch` runs.
- Removed redundant step-level `if` conditions from all artifact upload steps; the `needs: create-release` dependency already guarantees a release exists.
- Corrected platform label "Android Mobile (Capacitor)" → "Android Mobile (native APK)".

## v1.1.3 — 2026-02-24

### 🔧 Maintenance (PR #22)
- Bumped Android `versionCode` from `1` → `2` and `versionName` from `0.1.0` → `0.2.0` to produce a distinct, identifiable dev build for sideload testing.

---

## v1.1.2 — 2026-02-24

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (PR #21)
- Fixed GitHub Releases never receiving build artifacts: `GITHUB_TOKEN`-generated tag pushes do not re-trigger downstream workflows, so `release.yml` never fired after `auto-release.yml` created the tag.
- Added `workflow_call` trigger (with `version` input) to `release.yml` so it can be invoked as a reusable workflow.
- Added `build-release-artifacts` job to `auto-release.yml` that calls `release.yml` directly after the release is published, attaching the Android APK, Windows installer, and web archive.
- All artifact upload steps now pass explicit `tag_name` derived from `needs.create-release.outputs.VERSION` instead of `github.ref_name` (which resolves to `"main"` in a `workflow_call` context).
